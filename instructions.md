# Frontend Development Guide for a Movie Script Writing App

## 1. Set Up the Project

- Install necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material react-redux reduxjs/toolkit axios
  ```
- Create a `vite.config.js` file to configure Vite and specify an alias for easier imports.

## 2. Folder Structure

Here's a suggested folder structure for your frontend:

```
/frontend
  /src
    /assets
    /components
    /containers
    /features
    /redux
    /services
    /utils
  /public
```

- `/assets`: Store images, fonts, and other static assets.
- `/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `/containers`: Higher-level components that compose UI elements.
- `/features`: Organize features/modules of your app. Each feature may have its folder containing components, actions, reducers, and selectors.
- `/redux`: Store configuration, reducers, and actions.
- `/services`: API services and utilities.
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers.

## 3. UI Development

- Start by translating the Figma design into React components using Material UI.
- Use Material UI's theming to maintain a consistent design.
- Follow responsive design principles for different screen sizes.
- Implement UI animations and transitions for a more engaging experience.

## 4. State Management with Redux Toolkit

- Define your application's state structure in Redux.
- Create reducers and actions using Redux Toolkit to manage the application state.
- Organize your Redux logic by feature/module.
- Use the `createAsyncThunk` API for handling asynchronous actions (e.g., API requests).

## 5. API Integration

- Create API service functions in the `/services` folder to interact with your backend.
- Use Axios or another HTTP library for making API requests.
- Implement error handling and data validation for API responses.

## 6. Routing

- Implement client-side routing using a library like `react-router-dom` to navigate between different pages or sections of your app.

## 7. Authentication

- If your app requires authentication, implement user registration, login, and session management.
- Use JWT for authentication and protect routes that require authentication.

## 8. Real-time Updates

- Implement real-time updates for collaborative editing if applicable, using WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io) for communication with the backend.

## 9. Testing

- Write unit tests and integration tests for your components and Redux logic using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

## 10. Performance Optimization

- Optimize your app's performance by lazy-loading components, code-splitting, and optimizing bundle sizes.
- Use tools like Lighthouse and Web Vitals to monitor and improve web performance.

## 11. Deployment

- Configure your Vite.js project for production deployment.
- Deploy your frontend to a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use React DevTools and Redux DevTools browser extensions for debugging and inspecting the state.
- Keep your components small and focused on a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Implement responsive design early to ensure a good user experience on various devices.
- Automate repetitive tasks with scripts (e.g., linting, formatting, testing) in your `package.json` file.

## Useful Libraries

- `react-query`: For handling data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend.
- `formik` and `yup`: For form validation and management.
- `react-query/devtools`: Provides a UI for debugging and monitoring React Query.
- `react-query/error-boundary`: Simplifies error handling in React Query.
- `react-toastify`: Display user-friendly notifications and alerts.
- `react-helmet-async`: Manage document head tags for SEO and better user experience.
- `react-icons`: Provides a wide range of icon libraries for Material UI components.

Remember to continuously test your app with real users, gather feedback, and iterate on your design and features to make the development process engaging and playful.
